Tell us about your idea

What is your idea or product? If you have drawings or renderings that will help you articulate your idea or product feel free to attach them to your reply.
This couch is to be a modern and comfortable design, competitive in all aspects with single-use equivalents on the market. Secondarily, the seat of this couch will open to reveal dozens of block cushions of varying shapes to facilitate in the construction of walls, towers, forts, etc.

How did you get this idea?
We loved (love, let's be honest) pillow forts and building blocks and would like to offer more creative potential to the children of today while not removing much-needed storage space from already crowded living areas.

What are your goals for the product or idea? To create a business, to license the Intellectual Property (IP) and so forth.
We would like to bring this idea to market and use it as a learning experience, and hopefully a revenue stream, to start a business.

What do you see as your target market?
Engaged parents looking to provide outlets for creativity to their children, creative college students, and playful adults.

What would you like Enventys to do? Where do you need support?
We come from science/engineering backgrounds and have laid out mostly how we would like the couch to function. What we do not have is experience in the furniture or manufacturing industries to where we would be confident choosing specific hinges, cushion densities, fabrics, frame materials, etc.; nor do we have experience preparing for potential large-scale manufacturing. We need advice in these areas. We are currently self-funded; it is also possible that what we need first is a functional proof-of-concept prototype for use in developing the necessary crowdfunding media to acquire funds for further research and development.

Do you have a Patent or is a Patent Pending?  (Is one required?)
No and we do not plan on patenting.

Have you disclosed the product publicly? If so, when?
No.

Have you already started developing the concept? If so, where are you in the
development process?
We are finished with the main concept and the bulk of the design. There are still a few aspects we would like to improve, but we could use consultation with experienced furniture manufacturers to facilitate these changes.

What other companies have you worked with?
None, though we have consultations scheduled with a few other prototyping firms.
